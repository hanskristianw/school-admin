1. Chung Chung Christian School’s Philosophy on Language 
At Chung Chung Christian School we believe that language is essential to the development of children as active learners. Language allows for the students to understand the world, learn new perspectives, and it fosters creativity. Language is not just a single subject class, but is a topic that is transdisciplinary and throughout the curriculum. Language is the cornerstone for inquiry and is the medium of instruction for all subjects. We believe that in order for the students to have a well-rounded education, all teachers must be active participants in the language learning process by teaching students through language and research. 
By focusing on language we allow the students to enhance their communication skills by learning through both verbal and non-verbal communications as well as strengthen their literacy and media skills by encouraging research. We believe that analysis and evaluation of information will empower the students to understand the world through language and that is the reason we hold language as one of the foundations of our education here. 
2. IB perspective on Language Learning
The International Baccalaureate (IB) places an emphasis on language across its various programs. It aims to foster intercultural understanding, develop appreciation for various cultures, and enhance communication skills. The IB supports learning and understanding multiple languages, critical thinking, and language and literature studies. Language is seen as a powerful tool for global engagement and responsible citizenship. 
Language learning in the IB context is a holistic process serving many purposes: facilitating communication in diverse contexts, fostering cultural appreciation and understanding, enabling the acquisition of additional languages, and developing literacy skills like reading and writing. The IB's approach recognizes language learning as a connected endeavor that both equips students with language proficiency but also brings about intercultural competence, critical thinking, and global citizenship. 
IB discusses language learning in three categories: learning language, learning through language and learning about language, as shown in Figure 1. 
* Language learning is described as the ability to engage with multiple languages using a variety of approaches that allow for the students to learn new skills and practice  them in the classroom. 
* Learning through language is the ability for students to understand new ideas through listening, reading, speaking, performing, writing and viewing texts. Teachers use language to create thoughtful and meaningful conversations in the classroom drawing on the prior knowledge of the students. 
* Learning about language is learning the forms, conventions, and context of using certain text types. This is where the students will learn how to create and understand texts and how to use them in their work (IBO, 2024). 
These aspects are closely related and they help us to understand how language is used to make connections and create meaning.

3. Students’ Language Profile
All of Chung Chung Christian School students are from Indonesia and most of our families primarily use Indonesian language and Surabaya dialect in the home. We do have some families who use English as their primary language though most of our students are coming from a home language background with English as an additional language. 



4. Internal Assessment and Placement 
To support student learning and ensure appropriate language instruction, internal assessments will be utilized to monitor student progress, identify areas of achievement, and address areas requiring further support. In addition, placement assessments will be administered to ensure that MYP students are placed in the appropriate language course—either Language Acquisition or Language and Literature—in alignment with their proficiency levels and educational needs.
4.1 Early Years (PYP)
        In the Early Years, language data will be collected upon students' entry to determine their language proficiency levels. This information will be used to ensure students can comprehend instructional language and actively participate in classroom activities. It also will help to imply necessary support to promote language development and access to the curriculum for each individual student’s needs.
4.2 Elementary (PYP)
        Language assessment data in the PYP will be used to understand each student's language abilities. This data supports the identification of students who may require additional classroom support or inclusion in differentiated language programmes. When students face challenges in participating due to language barriers, appropriate interventions will be implemented to support their development.
4.3 Middle Years Programme (MYP)
        In the MYP, language proficiency data is essential for accurately placing students in either Language and Literature or Language Acquisition for English. Students will be enrolled in Language and Literature for Bahasa Indonesia, recognizing it as their home language. For Chinese, all students will participate in Language Acquisition due to Chinese being an additional and students' language backgrounds.



5. Language Use (based on levels)
In our classrooms, English is used as the primary language of instruction. It provides a common ground for communication and prepares students for international opportunities. However, we recognize the importance of cultural diversity and linguistic richness. Therefore, we actively encourage the use of Bahasa Indonesian, as the students' home language, and Chinese, as an additional language, within the classroom. By doing so, we honor our students’ heritage, promote cross-cultural exchange, and create an inclusive environment. This approach allows learners to express themselves comfortably while developing proficiency in multiple languages. Our goal is to nurture well-rounded individuals who can navigate both local and global contexts with confidence. In all levels, the principle that "every teacher is a language teacher" is fundamental. This concept emphasizes the integral role of language in all aspects of learning and teaching.

5.1 Early Years
In the Early Years, we focus on introducing new language through play and songs. We create habits and routines around the activities that we do so the students are consistently achieving the language goals that we set. Additionally, we create a positive language environment by displaying vocabulary and simple sentences around that classroom that the students can use daily. We display Chinese, English, and Bahasa Indonesia around the classroom to encourage students to actively take part in learning all three languages. 
5.2 Primary Years Programme (PYP)
In the Primary Years Program (PYP), we encourage the natural authenticity of language learning. We aim to challenge the students in an environment rich with literature and many opportunities to inquire about new topics. We want the students to connect with a wide range of ideas by learning through language. They receive specialized classes for all languages which include phonemic awareness, reading, writing, listening, and speaking, but are also encouraged to become more literate in all of their classes through texts that allow them to explore and connect the world around them. 
5.3 Middle Years Programme (MYP)
In the MYP, we have two language paths for English: Language Literature and Language Acquisition. Students are tested before entering the school to accurately place them in the language that will fit their abilities best. In English, Chinese, and Bahasa Indonesia classes, the students are being exposed to different types of literature that will allow them to properly use the language as a learning tool. Every teacher is an active participant in teaching the students language that is related to their subject and will help the students be successful in all aspects of their learning. The primary language used in teaching is English but in specialized classes, we will use Chinese and Bahasa Indonesia accordingly. 



6. Support of Home Language and Culture Learning
We recognize the importance of a student's home language, and we actively encourage them to use it within the classroom. This recognition fosters a sense of belonging and inclusivity. Additionally, we practice routines that incorporate home languages into daily activities and students are encouraged to express themselves in their native language alongside English. We believe that when students feel that their home language is respected, they become more engaged in the classroom. By embracing the home language, we can create a culture that students can thrive academically while also celebrating their own culture.
We provide teachers with specializations in ensuring students continue to learn their home language by embedding cultural learning into the units of inquiry in the EY and EL PYP and through language lessons in the MYP. The students will have class in Bahasa Indonesia every week where they will learn language skills and the importance of knowing their background and heritage. 


7.         Teacher Responsibilities in Supporting Language Learning 
        At Chung Chung Christian School, we believe that every teacher is a language teacher. All teachers play an important role in developing students’ communication skills and supporting their growth in understanding and using language. Teachers model effective language use, provide opportunities for reading, writing, listening, and speaking, and intentionally create a language-rich classroom environment. 
        7.1 Early Years 
In the Early Years, teachers focus on building the foundation of communication through play, songs, stories, and daily routines. They model correct pronunciation and vocabulary, use gestures and visuals to support comprehension, and create a multilingual environment that encourages students to express themselves in English, Bahasa Indonesia, and Chinese. Classroom items are labelled in multiple languages, and storybooks are read in different languages to help students make connections between words and meaning. Teachers work closely together to ensure a balanced exposure to all school languages and to help children develop confidence in expressing their thoughts and ideas.
7.2 Primary Years Program (PYP) 
In the PYP, teachers integrate language learning into all subjects and units of inquiry. They model academic language and encourage students to use subject-specific vocabulary in meaningful contexts. Teachers plan learning experiences that allow students to read, write, and communicate their ideas across different disciplines. For example, in a Unit of Inquiry, students may research in their home language and present their findings in English. Classrooms display word walls in English, Bahasa Indonesia, and Chinese are used to support vocabulary development. Teachers promote inquiry by asking open-ended questions and providing opportunities for discussion and reflection.
7.3 Middle Years Program (MYP) 
In the MYP, teachers support students in developing higher levels of language proficiency and academic expression. Teachers design lessons that include extended communication, such as essays, debates, and presentations, and they differentiate instruction to meet the needs of both Language Acquisition and Language and Literature learners. In all subjects, teachers guide students in analyzing how language influences meaning and perspective. Teachers use language as a tool to deepen inquiry, reflection, and critical thinking.
7.4 Collaboration Across Levels 
Teachers across all programmes collaborate to ensure consistency in language goals and to share effective strategies that support multilingualism. They work together to design learning experiences that encourage students to use language purposefully and confidently in all areas of learning. This collaboration strengthens our belief that language is at the heart of learning and that every teacher contributes to the development of students as capable communicators and global citizens.

8.         Differentiation 
We understand that differentiated instruction plays an important role in meeting the needs of our diverse group of students. We recognize that every student brings their own background knowledge, experiences, culture, language, and learning preferences. Our teachers strive to effectively modify their content, process, product, and affect to meet these individual needs and language abilities in the classroom. 
7.1 Early Years
In the Early Years, each classroom is staffed with two teachers to ensure students receive individualized attention. Additionally, flexible grouping and one-on-one instructional support are used to assist students in developing foundational language skills within the classroom environment.
7.2 Primary Years Programme (PYP)
In the PYP, students who demonstrate significant difficulty with English may receive additional language support through a pull-out system. These students are temporarily withdrawn from Chinese lessons to participate in focused English language instruction. This ensures that they can access the curriculum and follow classroom instructions effectively.
7.3 Middle Years Programme (MYP)
In the MYP, English instruction is delivered through differentiated classrooms, allowing teachers to tailor learning experiences according to students’ proficiency levels. For Bahasa Indonesia and Chinese, teachers employ a range of strategies including small group work, one-on-one instruction, and project-based learning to support student comprehension and engagement in the language. 



9. Resources
Here we have two libraries dedicated to supporting the education and inquiry of our students. We aim to create a space that the students can use to delve further into their studies with resources of many genres and backgrounds. We have books in English, Chinese, and Bahasa Indonesia within the library with the majority of our books being in the English language. We also take advantage of the use of e-books to further support in the lessons and units of inquiry. Our library team works closely with teachers to curate resources that align with transdisciplinary themes and subject areas, support the development of research skills, and promote academic integrity and information literacy.
