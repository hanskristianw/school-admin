ADMISSION POLICIES




Rationale
At Chung Chung Christian School, our admissions policy reflects our commitment to the vision of being a world-leading Christian school that nurtures students holistically: mind, heart, strength, and spirit for a better world and the glory of God.
Guided by this vision, we welcome students from diverse backgrounds[1] [2]who demonstrate a passion for learning[3], a commitment to personal growth[4], and a desire to contribute positively to their communities[5].
Biblical Perspective
1. Transparent. Transparency is a cornerstone of our admissions process[6]. God called us to be transparent and honest. Therefore, we are upfront and honest about our identity as a Christian school[7], rooted in biblical principles and committed to fostering a Christ-centered environment. 
2. Inclusive.  Inclusivity is also a foundation of our admissions process. As a Christian school rooted in biblical principles, we warmly welcome students from all backgrounds who are open to engaging with our values and vision, just as God welcomes people of all races, backgrounds, and cultures[8]. By embracing inclusivity, we strive to create a diverse community where every student feels valued and empowered to grow holistically—mind, heart, strength, and spirit—for a better world and the glory of God.
3. Warm and Professional. Motivated by love for God and others, CCS seeks to maintain a warm[9] and professional[10] approach throughout the admissions process. Our dedicated team is here to guide families with care and respect, ensuring that every interaction reflects the values of kindness and excellence we hold dear. We strive to create an environment where prospective students and their families feel welcomed, supported, and valued as they consider joining our school community. 
4. Fair and Non-Partial. God gives us His law to maintain fairness, honesty and justice. Fairness and honesty are integral to our admissions process. We are committed to ensuring that every applicant is treated with respect and evaluated based on clear, equitable criteria. CCS sees each applicant as precious, created by God, and worthy of respect [11]. Furthermore, God does not show partiality[12] and calls us to show no partiality[13] . Each application is therefore considered seriously and effort is taken to avoid discrimination, for example, based on race or family background.
5. Confidential and Private. Confidentiality and security of all admission-related documents[14]. We are committed to protecting the personal information of our applicants and their families through robust digital protection measures and secure storage practices. All records are handled with the utmost discretion and used solely for the purposes of the admissions process. By upholding these standards, we ensure that every family’s trust in our school is honored and safeguarded.
6. Compliance to school Vision, Mission, Value and Regulation. While CCS embraces inclusivity, we strongly encourage prospective students and their families to understand and adhere to CCS vision, mission[15], school culture, and C.H.R.I.S.T values[16]. Any applicants who cannot support or comply with these principles may not be admitted into our school community.
7. Wisdom in Respecting Freedom of Religion. CCS encourages students and parents to wholeheartedly embrace the Christian foundation of the school and align with its vision, mission, and values, which are integral to our community. At the same time, CCS respects freedom of religion as a fundamental human right and welcomes students from all religious backgrounds without imposing a requirement to adopt Christianity. Prospective students and families are welcomed for their willingness to engage with the school’s values without requiring them to convert or adopt Christianity[17]. While maintaining the school’s Christian foundation and values, it is not the responsibility of the school to pass judgment on students or families from other religious backgrounds.
8. Wise consideration of situational conditions. CCS takes seriously its God-given responsibility to provide excellent education for all members of the learning community. In order to do this, CCS must consider[18] [19] whether they are able to meet the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of a candidate before accepting them.

Admission Procedure
At Chung Chung Christian School, our admissions process is designed to be thorough, supportive, and aligned with our commitment to fostering a Christ-centered learning environment. The following steps outline our procedure:
1. Registration Form Submission
Prospective students must obtain and complete a registration form, available from our administration office. The completed form should be submitted along with a copy of the student’s most recent report card.
2. Enrollment Test and Interview Scheduling
Once the registration form is submitted, the candidate student will be scheduled for an enrollment test and an interview with our school counselor. This interview focuses on understanding the student's social and communication skills to assess how well they may adapt to our school environment.
3. Admission Test and Student Interview
The candidate student will complete an admission test and participate in an interview. The test evaluates their academic readiness, while the interview helps us learn more about their personal growth and potential.
4. Parent Interview
Parents of the candidate student will also be interviewed. This step allows us to cross-check information provided during the student interview and gather insights about the student's learning styles and progress. It also serves as an opportunity to build a strong partnership with the family.
5. Fee Payment
After the assessment and interview process, successful candidates must pay the school fees to confirm their registration.
6. Programme Details Orientation
Once the enrollment process is completed and registration is confirmed, new students and their families are invited to attend a Programme Details Orientation session. For students enrolling in the International Baccalaureate (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) or Middle Years Programme (MYP), this orientation provides a comprehensive overview of the IB framework, including its emphasis on inquiry-based learning, global contexts, and the development of the IB Learner Profile. Families will receive detailed information about the curriculum, assessment methods, and the unique opportunities provided by the IB PYP and MYP.
7. Introduction to PAG (Parent Advisory Group)
The students and parents will be induced into our support structures such as PAG, extracurricular activities, and the values that guide our Christ-centered approach to the IB curriculum. This orientation ensures that families are well-informed and prepared to fully engage with the enriching educational experience at Chung Chung Christian School.

4. Upon completion of all procedures, the school will notify parents regarding the admission decision. If the student with special education needs is accepted, the school will formalize an agreement with the parents, outlining the conditions and expectations for the student’s progress and the support provided.
Candidate Students from Other Schools
1. An initial meeting between the candidate student’s parents, the school principal, and the school counselor will be conducted to assess and align the student’s needs with the school’s readiness and capacity to provide appropriate support.
2. If the school determines it has the capacity to accept the student, the admission process will proceed.
3. The school principal will formalize an agreement letter with the parents of the student with special education needs. This letter will outline the student’s progress expectations, available interventions, and other conditions of acceptance to ensure mutual understanding and support.
