Professional Conduct Guidelines for Teachers 
As educators at Chung Chung Christian School, teachers are called not only to deliver academic instruction but also to model professional behavior in alignment with our school's values and vision. The following guidelines serve as a clear standard for conduct and boundaries:


1. Dress Code and Personal Appearance
Teachers and staff are expected to present themselves in a professional and respectful manner in line with CCS standards:
* Attire should be formal, neat, clean, and appropriate for working with children. Revealing or overly casual attire (e.g., short skirts, ripped jeans, low-cut/cropped tops) is not appropriate.
* Hair must be clean and tidy. Unnatural hair colors (e.g., bright pink, neon green) should be avoided.
* Nails should be clean and at a practical length. Overly long or distracting nail designs are discouraged.
* Makeup and Jewelry should be modest and not distracting.
* Tattoos must be covered during school/working hours and school events.
* Footwear must be closed shoes, comfortable and appropriate (not in stand out color) for teaching. Shoes must be worn in the school areas. 
2. Posting Students on Social Media
Posting any photos, videos, or information of CCS students on staff’s personal social media is strictly prohibited. Any documentation involving students must be shared through official school channels and only with prior parental consent.
3. Social Media Relationships
Teachers and staff must not connect on social media (e.g., Instagram, Facebook, WA, TikTok) with current students or parents. Maintain boundaries between personal and professional life by using only school-approved platforms for parent communication (e.g., official LineGroups, WhatsApp groups, school email).


4. Professional Boundaries and Physical Contact
* Teachers are to maintain respectful, appropriate physical boundaries with students.
* Physical touch should be limited, age-appropriate (e.g., high five), and never initiated in private settings.
* Teachers must avoid actions that may be misinterpreted or breach a student’s personal space or comfort.






5. Private Tutoring
Teachers are not allowed to provide tutoring to CCS students to avoid conflict of interest. Tutoring outside CCS is permitted but must not interfere with working hours or responsibilities at CCS.


6. Gratification and Gift Policy
In line with our school values, cash, monetary gifts, and jewelry are not allowed under any circumstances. If parents and families wish to express their appreciation, they are welcomed to contribute shared snacks or drinks that can be enjoyed together, greeting cards, or student-made items.

7. Fairness and Avoiding Favoritism
Teachers must treat all students equitably. Favoritism or having a “teacher’s pet” undermines classroom trust and is discouraged.


8. Punctuality
Punctuality is a core professional responsibility. Teachers are expected to arrive on time and be present for all assigned duties, meetings, and classes. Teachers must notify the Principal/HOD if running late or absent, ideally the night before. Repeated lateness, early departures, or unauthorized absences will be addressed by school leadership.

9. Absence, Early Leave, and Late Arrival Protocol
* Teachers must notify the Principal/HOD as early as possible, preferably the night before and are expected to prepare lesson plans in advance for planned absences.
* Submit leave or early dismissal requests via proper forms and receive Principal/HOD approval.
* Absences due to illness beyond one day require a doctor’s note.


10. Smoking and Alcohol
Smoking and alcohol consumption are not permitted on school premises or during any school-related activity. As role models, staff are expected to maintain behavior that reflects the school’s Christian values both on and off campus.


11. Communication & Relationships
* All communication with students, parents, and colleagues should be respectful, professional, and supportive.
* When addressing student misbehavior, use calm, constructive language that supports restoration and learning.
* It is essential that staff maintain emotional balance and composure at all times, especially in the presence of students. Teachers must remain in the classroom and should not leave students unattended, even during emotionally difficult moments. 
* Manage emotion by taking a deep breath and count silently, say a short prayer or refocus your thoughts, speak in a calm and respectful tone, redirect students to independent work if you need a moment, seek support from a colleague or supervisor if needed.


12. Lunch breaks 
* Staff are not permitted to leave school grounds during lunch breaks.
* All teachers and staff are expected to remain on campus and have lunch at school. Meals may be brought from home or ordered from online food delivery services.
* This ensures availability for duties and emergency responses, and builds a sense of staff community.


13. Financial Ethics
* Lending or borrowing money among staff is strongly discouraged, as it may lead to misunderstandings or tension.
* Staff are expected to handle personal finances privately and professionally.


14. Selling Goods at School
Staff may engage in small-scale sales (e.g. food, crafts) with approval from school leadership, provided it does not interfere with their primary responsibility of teaching and supporting students.


15. Handling Gossip 
* Gossip undermines trust and community sense. Staff should refrain from gossiping and instead, address concerns through open, respectful dialogue.
* Use Matthew 18 as a biblical model: address the person directly first; if unresolved, involve a senior staff member or principal.
* Public display of affection between married/in a relationship staff is discouraged. 


16. Teachers with Children Enrolled in the School
* Teachers must maintain clear boundaries between their roles as educators and as parents.
* Personal family concerns should not be brought into staff meetings, classroom settings, or professional discussions unless relevant and done through proper channels.
* Teachers must not use their position to access or share confidential academic or behavioral information about their own children or other students.
* Any school-related matters concerning their own children must follow the same parent communication process as other families.
* Teachers who are also parents must model respectful behavior in both roles, showing integrity in how they speak about and represent the school.
17. Emotional Well-being
* We acknowledge emotional moments may occur. If experiencing a meltdown or distress, including in private spaces like restrooms, seek support from a counselor or trusted colleague.
* We encourage a culture where seeking help is a strength, not a weakness.


18. Resolving Conflict
* Conflicts with others should be addressed directly, respectfully, and privately whenever possible.
* If needed, mediation may be requested through school leadership or HR.


19. Food, Gifts, Stickers for Students
* Sharing food, stickers, or personal gifts with students is not allowed, in order to maintain equity and avoid perceptions of favoritism or partiality.
* Classroom incentives must be standardized and approved as part of the school's behavior or reward systems.


20. Use of Internet and Devices
* Internet access and school devices must be used strictly for educational or administrative purposes.
* Staff must not download/stream movies, games, or unrelated content onto school systems.
* Be vigilant about protecting students and yourself from inappropriate content or misuse of technology.
* Personal phone calls or text messaging during teaching hours is not permitted, unless it is an emergency.
