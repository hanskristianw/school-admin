ASSESSMENT POLICY


FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS
   1. PHILOSOPHY
Chung Chung Christian School recognizes the crucial role of assessment in supporting student learning, personal growth, and achievement of learning goals. Our assessment policy is grounded in the belief that assessment is an integral and ongoing process that aligns with the IB philosophy. We aim to develop assessment capable learners who are independent, self aware, and actively engaged in their own learning journey.
This philosophy aligns perfectly with our school's vision to nurture students holistically. We strive not only to develop academic abilities but also to foster social and emotional competencies. Therefore, we are committed to ensuring that every assessment we undertake is meaningful, fair, and serves the best interests of our students.
We believe in evaluating students fairly and consistently across all subject areas. Our approach considers both the products of learning and the learning process itself. This holistic perspective allows us to gain a comprehensive understanding of each student's progress, strengths, and areas for development. By embracing the principles of assessment for learning, we empower our students to become confident, lifelong learners who are well prepared to face the challenges of an ever changing world.
   2. PURPOSES 
For Students
The primary purpose of assessment at Chung Chung Christian School is to provide meaningful feedback that enhances learning. Assessment serves as a valuable tool for students to recognize their achievements and identify areas for improvement. Through this process, students are empowered to take ownership of their learning, set personal goals, and monitor their progress throughout their educational journey. Regular and constructive feedback supports our students in overcoming challenges, enriching their learning experiences, and deepening their understanding of concepts and skills.
For Teachers
Assessment forms an integral part of our curriculum as it directly informs future planning and teaching. Through careful analysis of assessment data, teachers can identify areas where students excel and recognize where additional support may be needed. This valuable information enables teachers to adapt their instructional strategies, differentiate learning experiences, and provide targeted interventions that ensure every student has the opportunity to succeed. Furthermore, assessment allows teachers to reflect on the effectiveness of their teaching practices and make necessary adjustments to continuously improve student learning outcomes.






For Parents
Assessment provides parents with valuable insights into their child's progress by highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. This information helps parents support their child's learning at home and collaborate effectively with teachers to ensure their child reaches full potential. Regular assessment updates allow parents to track their child's growth over time and engage in meaningful discussions about education and future goals.


   3. PRINCIPLES
At Chung Chung Christian School, we embrace four fundamental principles of assessment:
1. Transfer 
We design assessments that challenge students to apply their knowledge and skills to new and authentic contexts. This approach fosters the development of transferable understanding that students can use beyond the classroom.
2. Cultures of Growth 
We cultivate a growth mindset throughout our school community by emphasizing the importance of continuous improvement and lifelong learning. We celebrate progress, effort, and perseverance, recognizing that learning is an ongoing journey.
3. Feedback 
We view feedback as a dynamic, two way process. Teachers provide timely, specific, and actionable feedback that enables students to reflect on their learning, set goals, and adjust their learning strategies. Similarly, we encourage students to provide feedback to their teachers, creating a collaborative and reflective learning community.
4. Validity 
We ensure that our assessments are valid and aligned with intended learning outcomes to provide fair and accurate representations of each student's achievements and potential. By designing assessments that accurately measure student learning and progress while considering the diverse needs and abilities of our students, we generate meaningful data that informs our teaching practices and supports student growth.

PYP ASSESSMENT 
Implementation of Assessment


The purpose of assessment is to enhance learning and teaching. It involves the collection and analysis of information regarding student learning to inform instructional practices. Assessment identifies what students know, understand, and are capable of at various stages of the learning process.
  



Assessment, From Principles into Practice 2019


Teachers in this study support the theme of a holistic approach to assessment, describing it as a cycle that is well integrated into teaching. Further, the diverse purposes of assessment are evident in the PYP schools. The Assessment Practice is based on the four dimensions of assessment
























  

Figure 1. Diagram of the four dimensions in the PYP assessment




	Assessment FOR Learning
	Assessment AS Learning
	Assessment OF Learning
	Monitoring
	* Support teachers to identify areas where students may need additional support or guidance and adapt their teaching strategies to meet the needs of individual learners.


	* Students develop self-awareness and the ability to identify their strengths and areas for improvement


	* To provide data on the effectiveness of teaching and learning practices. 
* To evaluate the overall success of educational programs and make necessary adjustments.
	Documenting
	* Documenting student progress, feedback, and observations throughout the learning process to provide evidence of student learning progress.


	* Encouraging students to document their own learning journey through reflective journals, portfolios, or learning logs promotes self-reflection and self-assessment
	* Documenting summative assessment results, such as rubric evaluations, provides a formal record of student achievement which is used for reporting purposes.
	Measuring
	* Measuring student progress formatively allows teachers to gauge the effectiveness of their instruction and make data-driven decisions. 


	* By engaging in self-assessment and peer assessment, students learn to measure their own progress and provide constructive feedback against established criteria 


	* Measuring student achievement through summative assessments, such as projects, or 


performances, provides a comprehensive evaluation of student learning. These measurements are 


used to determine grades, report on student progress, and make decisions about program effectiveness.


	Reporting
	* Reporting on formative assessment data helps teachers communicate student progress and areas for growth to students, parents, and other stakeholders. This reporting can take the learning progress or parent-teacher meetings as necessary. 
	* Reporting the students’ individual reflection on their learning is in the form of regular sharing with parents facilitated by the school termly. 
	* Reporting final results, such as report cards,  provides a summary of student performance and is used for decision-making purposes. 


	



Throughout our Programme of Inquiry, students are offered opportunities to share their conceptual understanding as they actively participate in the learning process. Student learning is promoted through assessing prior knowledge and experiences, creating meaningful learning opportunities, regularly engaging in self-assessment and reflection, providing feedback to guide next steps, collaborating with peers and offering peer assessment, promoting intercultural understanding, and encouraging student agency.

Teacher Moderation


Teachers design the assessments collaboratively to ensure consistency and fairness in assessment practices across different classes or grade levels. Below are the assessment criteria represent different levels of student performance:


Indicators
	Descriptors
	Beginning (B)
	This indicates that a student is just starting to acquire the skills or knowledge related to a specific learning outcome or objective. They are at the initial stages of development and 


may require additional support and guidance to progress further.
	Developing (D)
	This suggests that a student is making progress and showing improvement in the targeted areas. They are in the process of acquiring the skills and knowledge expected at their grade level but may not have fully mastered them yet.
	Achieving (A)
	When a student is described as achieving, it means they have successfully reached the expected level of competence or proficiency in the given subject or skill. They have met the learning outcomes and are performing at or near the expected grade level.
	Exceeding (E)
	Exceeding indicates that a student has surpassed the expected level of achievement. They have not only met the learning objectives but have demonstrated a higher level of mastery, often going above and beyond what is typically expected for their grade level.
