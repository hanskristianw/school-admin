INCLUSION POLICIES 
        Rationale
The vision of CCS as a world-leading Christian school that nurtures students holistically, mind, heart, strength, and spirit for a better world and the glory of God, our mission is deeply rooted in the biblical understanding that every person is created in the image of God (Genesis 1:27). This belief, often expressed by the term imago Dei, affirms that each student carries intrinsic dignity and value as a reflection of our Creator. 
At CCS, our staff are dedicated to recognising and celebrating differences. We are committed to providing challenges and tailored opportunities to students with unique gifts and strengths, ensuring that every learner is supported in their learning process. By integrating these biblical principles with the values of the IB Learner Profile, we believe each student can become living expressions of our vision–helping to build a more inclusive, caring, balanced, principled and compassionate world for the glory of God.
Recognizing each student as a unique image-bearer of God, CCS is committed to support their learning and encourage their growth cognitively, emotionally, physically and spiritually. (CCS’s understanding and practice of inclusion must be applied in a way that is consistent with other school policies such as the admissions and behavior policy.)
Definition of Inclusion 
The IB defines inclusion as follows:
Inclusion is an ongoing process that aims to increase access and engagement in learning for all students by identifying and removing barriers. Inclusion is an organizational paradigm that involves change. It is a continual process of increasing learning and participation for all students. It addresses learning support requirements and questions the broader objectives of education, the nature of pedagogy, curriculum and assessment. It is an educational approach to which all schools should aspire. Inclusion is facilitated in a culture of collaboration, mutual respect, support and problem-solving involving the whole school community (https://blogs.ibo.org/2016/08/26/what-is-inclusion/).
Who is included in this policy? 
Learner variability is a term that embraces all students and treats them with equal respect and care regardless of strengths, challenges, age, social status, economic status, language, biological sex, race, or ethnicity. Taking into account changing histories, circumstances and contexts, learner variability represents the shifting combination of strengths and challenges that learners experience. (CCS has a separate admissions policy that outlines admissions criteria and processes.)
We do not want the labelling and diagnostic test to define or limit our students but otherwise we utilise these tools to better support our unique students conditions. (Learning diversity and inclusion in IB programmes, 2018, p3 ). Within this understanding, it is recognised that there is no average brain and thus no average student, each student is unique.

Biblical Perspective and Principle of Inclusion
Inclusion in education requires a holistic approach that ensures every individual, regardless of background, ability, socioeconomic status, race, or sex is provided equitable learning opportunities and the supportive environment necessary to thrive. Scripture provides clear and compelling guidance on how to honour one another and serve the needs of all.  
In CCS the inclusion concept itself is built on several key principles:
1. Equal Opportunity and Access
Every student should have access to quality education that meets their unique needs[1] . CCS warns against favouritism, urging us to treat each person with fairness and compassion. CCS has dedicated resources, such as school counsellors, technology, and IB inclusive guides that help bridge existing gaps. 
2. Diversity and Respect
CCS as an inclusive educational setting acknowledges and respects the cultural, social, and intellectual diversity of its students. In Christ, all distinctions dissolve, affirming that every individual is equally cherished and worthy of respect[2]. Hence in CCS teachers and curriculum designers incorporate diverse perspectives, ensuring that lessons resonate with students.
3. Holistic Development
CCS nurtures our students holistically, beyond academic skills, human inclusion focuses on the emotional, social, and ethical development of each student. In CCS holistic means the development of minds[3] [4], heart [5] [6],  and strength. [7] Equally the IB reflects holistic education from the IB learner profile.
4. Practical Implementation
CCS is committed to putting into practice that which it believes[8].
1. Policy and Curriculum. CCS adopts policies that promote inclusivity, such as anti-discrimination[9] guidelines and inclusive curriculum reforms.
2. Dedicated Inclusive Training. Educators receive training in differentiated instruction, response to intervention (RTI) and inclusive classroom management to address the needs of a diverse student body.
3. Support Structures. CCS has support such as tutoring, counselling, and peer support groups to help ensure that students who may struggle are not left behind.
This policy is a living document, reflective of our unwavering commitment to an inclusive, just, and compassionate education for all[10]. By embracing these principles, CCS endeavours to create an environment where every student can flourish, thereby embodying our vision as a world-leading Christian school and contributing to the betterment of our community for the glory of God.
Policy Statement
At CCS, inclusive education is more than a policy. It's a practical, everyday commitment to ensuring every student thrives. Here’s how it looks in practice:
1. Differentiated Curriculum.
Lessons are designed with flexibility in mind, allowing teachers to tailor content and assessment to meet a range of abilities and learning styles. This ensures that every student, whether they require additional support or extra challenge, can engage meaningfully with the material.
2. Adaptive Teaching Methods.
CCS trains our educators in techniques such as differentiated instruction RTI and Universal Design for Learning (UDL). This means lessons are crafted to be accessible from the outset, reducing the need for later adaptations and ensuring all learners can participate fully.
3. Robust Support Structures.
CCS offer support, including dedicated school counsellors, peer mentoring programmes. These resources help identify individual needs early, ensuring timely intervention and ongoing assistance. Nevertheless, CCS does not have dedicated specialist shadow teachers and our support has limitations as CCS is a normal school and not a special needs school.
4. Accessible Environment.
CCS’s physical spaces are designed to be welcoming and minimal barrier, with some assistive technologies and resources available. This commitment extends to both classroom settings and extracurricular areas, fostering an environment where every student feels valued and safe.
5. Inclusive Assessment Practices.
Assessments can be varied and flexible, enabling students to demonstrate their understanding in diverse ways. This approach recognises that every student’s strengths are different and that there is no single standard of achievement.
6. Parental and Community Engagement.
We work closely with families and the wider community to support each student’s development. Regular communication and collaborative planning ensure that learning extends beyond the classroom, with every stakeholder playing a role in fostering inclusion.
7. Professional Development.
Continuous training ensures our staff remain current with best practices in inclusive education. By staying informed and adaptable, our educators can better support the diverse needs of our students.
Roles and Responsibilities
   1. Pastoral Care Coordinator (Wakasis)
Oversees the overall inclusion process and acts as the primary point of contact. Wakasis will become the executive leader for the inclusion/pastoral matters under the coordination of the school principal. 


   2. School Counselor 
Coordinating more complex pastoral matters that homeroom teachers cannot deal with, the school counselor acts as the second line of contact for daily pastoral issues.
   * Managing the inclusion and pastoral matters under the coordination of Wakasis. 
   * Supporting students’ emotional and mental well-being through one-on-one sessions, small group work, or referrals when necessary.
   * Collaborating with teachers and parents to create strategies that help students manage behavioral, social, or academic challenges.
   * Leading or supporting school-wide initiatives that promote a positive and inclusive school environment, such as (but not limited to) anti-bullying programs or mental health awareness campaigns.


   3. Homeroom Teachers
   * Managing daily pastoral matters and serving as the first point of contact for student well-being, specific needs, and behavior concerns.
   * Building strong relationships with students to monitor their academic progress, social development, and emotional health.
   * Addressing minor issues independently and referring more complex cases to the school counselor when additional support is needed.
   * Communicating regularly with parents and collaborating with the wider pastoral team to ensure consistent and effective support for each student.
   * Reporting students' academic results regularly in as report comments. 


   4. Parents
   * Parents lay the foundation for their child’s values, behavior, and emotional well-being. Their guidance at home strongly influences how a child interacts and copes at school.
   * Staying in regular contact with the homeroom teacher and school helps create a consistent support system for the child.
   * Reinforcing school values and expectations at home helps students feel secure and supported in both environments.
   * Sharing concerns early (whether emotional, behavioral, social, etc.) allows the school to respond quickly and provide appropriate support.
   * Together, working with the school to solve the child’s pastoral/behavior needs, including when dealing with specific inclusive needs/conditions. 


   5. Students
   * Students are expected to take care of themselves and others. Treating people with respect, being honest, and making positive choices.
   * Speaking up with respect. When facing a genuine issue, students are encouraged to talk to the homeroom teacher or a school counselor and ask for help as needed. 
   * Students might also need to talk to parents about their school concerns as part of the open communication. 
   * Take part in class discussions, school activities, and pastoral programs that help build a positive and supportive school community.
   * Be kind, include others, and report bullying and unkind or mischievous behavior. Supporting your classmates is part of building a safe environment for everyone.
Inclusion Support Standard (Procedures)
Homeroom Level
   1. Homeroom teachers monitor students’ academic progress, behavior, and emotional well-being, noting in the case, if any, emerging concerns.
   2. Homeroom will handle most students. 
   3. In the case when homeroom teachers have difficulties when dealing with specific students, the homeroom teachers document observations and refer students showing signs of distress or difficulties to the school counselor and the year-level meeting.
   4. Homeroom will meet with parents regularly in the Parent-Teacher conference during report time or as needed and can accompany the school counselor.
School Counselor
   1. The School Counselor conducts a preliminary assessment through one-on-one sessions. Based on this initial assessment, the counselor may suggest and confirm the need for intervention. 
   2. The School Counselor will coordinate with the Pastoral Vice Principal (Wakasis) to notify and work with parents. 
   3. In collaboration with the student, parents, homeroom teacher, and School Counselor, a tailored modified study plan is developed outlining specific goals, strategies, and timelines. 
   4. Drawing on their expertise, the School Counselor might recommend involving an external specialist—such as a psychologist, special needs learning support professional, or mental health specialist—as needed. (The school will recommend appropriate specialists.)
   5. The School Counselor and homeroom teachers schedule periodic meetings with students to review progress and adapt the Modified Study Plan (MSP) as needed. 
   6. All interventions, observations, and adjustments to the support plan are recorded securely and updated regularly by the School Counselor. 
   7. Parents are informed primarily through scheduled MSP updates provided by homeroom teachers and, when necessary, through meetings to ensure consistent support between home and school.
Wakasis
   1. If additional support is warranted, the case is escalated to the Pastoral Vice Principal (Wakasis) for further review and action. 
   2. The counselor will report on specific students of concern to Wakasis on a regular basis. All communication with parents must be coordinated by Wakasis. 
   3. When CCS identifies a special case in which it cannot appropriately provide support, CCS will work with parents to explore any feasible solutions. CCS will communicate honestly in these situations, and it is the responsibility of Wakasis to coordinate and communicate with parents accordingly.
Parents
   1. Parents have the responsibility to work with the school, including MSP, to support the well-being of their children. 
   2. It is the parents’ responsibility to bear the cost of additional support, such as an external specialist, a psychologist, special needs learning support, or a shadow teacher. 
   3. The parents recognize that CCS is not a special needs school and, therefore, can only provide support equivalent to that of a regular school
Confidentiality and Digital Protection
        All student records related to pastoral and inclusion support are maintained securely, with access restricted to authorised staff. Information is shared only with parental consent or when required by school policy or law.

[1] James 2:1–4 My brothers,[a] show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. 2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, 3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” 4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
[2] Galatians 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[3] Romans 12:2
“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.”
This verse encourages the pursuit of wisdom and critical thinking, inspiring students to seek transformation through the renewal of their minds.
[4] Colossians 3:2
“Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.” It calls for a focus on higher, eternal values, guiding learners to cultivate a perspective that transcends the immediate and material.
[5] Matthew 22:37
“And he said to him, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’” This commandment underscores the importance of love and devotion, fostering an emotional connection to God and to others.
[6] Proverbs 4:23 “Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life.” It highlights the need for inner integrity and emotional well-being, emphasizing that a well-tended heart is crucial for overall growth.
[7] Ephesians 6:10 “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.” This verse reinforces that true strength, physical, emotional, and spiritual comes from relying on God's power.
[8] James 2:18  “But someone will say, “You have faith; I have deeds. Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[9] Acts 10:34-35 (KJV) "Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, 'Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.'" This passage, spoken by Peter, highlights that God's acceptance is not based on human distinctions such as ethnicity, social status, or any other factor. It calls us to reflect this divine inclusivity by treating everyone with equal respect and fairness.


[10] James 1: 23. “Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a mirror.” Practice has to be reflected to ensure the competency between faith and deeds.
